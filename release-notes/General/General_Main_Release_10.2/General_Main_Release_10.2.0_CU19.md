### Enhancements

*No enhancements have been added to this release yet.*

### Fixes

#### Dashboards app: Height of 'Data used in Dashboard' section would not be reduced when you deleted multiple components at once [ID_37032]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU19]/10.3.0 [CU7] - FR 10.3.9 -->

When, while in edit mode, you deleted multiple components at once, the *Data used in Dashboard* section of the edit pane would not be updated correctly. The data would be removed, but the height of the section would incorrectly not be reduced.

#### Dashboards app/Low-Code Apps: Visual glitch when closing component menu [ID_37058]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU19]/10.3.0 [CU7] - FR 10.3.10 -->

When the menu of a component in a dashboard or low-code app was closed by moving the mouse pointer out of it at the bottom center, a visual glitch could occur where the menu appeared to rapidly open and close.
