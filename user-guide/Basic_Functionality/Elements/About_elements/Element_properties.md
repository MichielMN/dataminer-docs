# Element properties

By adding properties to views, elements, services and alarms, you can link all kinds of additional information to those DataMiner items. This information can be displayed in the Alarm Console and can be used when creating filters and Correlation rules.

Each property has a name, a value and a type.

There are two types of properties:

- **read-only**: The property and its value can only be displayed, not edited. Properties of this type are managed by the DataMiner System.

- **read-write**: The property and its value can both be displayed and edited. Properties of this type are managed by DataMiner users.
