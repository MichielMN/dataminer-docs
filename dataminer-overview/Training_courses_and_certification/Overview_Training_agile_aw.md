# Agile Awareness Training

While Agile plays a crucial role in many aspects of any business, and it may seem like a relatively simple concept, it is in fact a major undertaking to make it a reality. **Implementing Agile is a multifaceted and diverse process** and in fact also a journey without a final destination. Our Agile Awareness Training is aimed to support you in this journey and provide your team with the keys to success in the new data-driven era.

## Long-term transformation

To implement Agile, everyone must adopt a new mindset with new values and principles. The necessary tools, technologies, methodologies and best practices must be introduced. Existing structures must be reformed. The multitude of changes effectively **affect everything you are accustomed to**.

However, as most of us know very well, organizations and people by nature are inclined to resist change. Changing and letting go of old habits takes time, and therefore it unavoidably **requires dedication and continuous attention**. One training course, one lecture or speech, and one booklet with some guidelines are not enough. What you need is long-term transformation and dedication to flourishing in the new data-driven future.

## Agile as a key to success
